# PetFinder

A full-stack platform designed to reunite missing pets with their owners — community-driven, secure, and user-friendly.

---

## 🐾 Project Description

PetFinder is a web application built to help communities report lost pets, post found pets, and connect pet owners with finders. Think of it as a focused, safe, and reliable “missing pets version of Facebook Marketplace.” Our mission: Reunite pets and people!

**Core Features:**
- Report lost pets so others can help locate them
- Post found pets for quick owner recovery
- Connect owners and finders in a trusted network
- Secure authentication and data management

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17+**
- **Node.js & npm** _(if you add any frontend build tools)_
- **MySQL Server**

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prabhashperera/Find-Care-Full-Stack-App-Spring-Boot.git
cd Find-Care-Full-Stack-App-Spring-Boot
```

### 2. Configure MySQL Database

- Create a database (e.g., `petfinder`)
- Update `application.properties` (Spring Boot) with your DB credentials:
  ```
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/petfinder
  spring.datasource.username=YOUR_DB_USER
  spring.datasource.password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
  ```

### 3. Backend: Run Spring Boot Application

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# or
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### 4. Frontend: Open HTML/CSS/JS Files

- Static files can be opened directly, or served via a local HTTP server for development.

```bash
# Example (if using http-server with Node.js)
npx http-server ./frontend
```

### 5. Authentication

- JWT-based authentication is implemented. Register, login, and use your JWT token for protected routes.
